TornadoUITopology

- Updated versions from 0.8 to 1.0.1 in pom.xml
- Had to add jars

From Skype Call (notebook)

Kafka Spout
- create new spout
- create new topology using the new kafka spout
- has a routing layer and evaluation layer

UI -> Kafka -> (tranformations) -> Tornado
UI <-> Kafka Spout (layers) <-> Tornado <-> Kafka Producer <-> UI

Need to convert to tornado object and reconvert back to original query object

Examples:
storm word count (get an idea of how storm works)


1) we will focus on the evaluation of the simple spatio-textual range query this query has a spatial range and set of keywords
2) Look at the examples folder you will see the tornadotweetcount example I want to create another class called  TornadoUIToplogy
3) In this new class you will follow the same approach adopted in the tweets count example. However, you will need to use the Kafkaspout to read queries from UI 
4) Send me bitbucket accounts and I will add you both to the version that was totally working with UI of Tornado

all i want now the TornadoUIToplogy topology to do is 
1) read sample tweets files
2) read queries from UI in json format and convert them into the query object
3) take the output and put it back to UI through the kafka producer 
4) add comments
